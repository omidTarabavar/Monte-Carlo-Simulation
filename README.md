# Monte Carlo Simulation for Project Management: A GUI Implementation

Description:
In this project, I've developed a user-friendly GUI tool using the TKinter library in Python to implement Monte Carlo Simulation. This powerful computational technique allows for probabilistic analysis of project timelines and risks by considering various uncertain factors. By simulating multiple project scenarios, the tool provides valuable insights for better project planning and decision-making.
