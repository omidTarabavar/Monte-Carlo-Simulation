# Monte Carlo Simulation: A GUI Implementation

Course: Management of Information Technology Projects

Description:
This project is a Python-based GUI tool developed with the Tkinter library to perform Monte Carlo Simulations. Created as part of the Management of Information Technology Projects course, the tool enables probabilistic analysis of project timelines and risks by incorporating uncertainty across multiple scenarios. By simulating various project outcomes, it provides valuable insights to improve project planning and facilitate more informed decision-making.
